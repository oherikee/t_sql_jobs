## Trend Period Analysis Documentation
<p> &emsp;The client needed to calculate the possible percentage physical progress in the civil project over the next three months, considering the trend. Each calculation would result in a table, where all the attributes would be:
  
  - Initial deviation;
  - Mobile diversion;
  - Previous estimate;
  - Current estimate;
  - Seasonal estimates;
  - Trend period.
The results should each be saved in a table (one for each period).

Below, see the structure of the tables in the database.</p>
